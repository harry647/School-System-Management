## Installation
Follow these steps to set up the School System Management application on your local machine.

1. **Clone the repository**:
   Clone the project from GitHub to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/harry647/School-System-Management.git
   cd School-System-Management

2. Set up a virtual environment:
   - Create a virtual environment to isolate dependencies (recommended):
. windows
   '''bash
   python -m venv venv
  - Activate the virtual environment
    '''bash
    venv\Scripts\activate
. On macOS/Linux:
'''bash
  source venv/bin/activate

3. Install dependencies: Install the required Python packages listed in requirements.txt:

pip install -r requirements.txt
- Verify installation: Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly by checking the Python environment:
-If no errors occur, the core libraries are installed. If errors arise, reinstall the dependencies or consult requirements.txt for specific versions.

4. Prepare for configuration: The application requires a configuration file and database, which are not included in the repository for security reasons. Proceed to the section to set these up.

## Configuration
1. Sensitive files (e.g., config.json, database) are not included in the repository. You must create and configure them manually.

2. Create a config.json file in the project root (School-System-Management/).
 - Use a template provided below:
{
  "database_config": {
    "database": "school_database.db"
  },
}

## Usage

1. Activate the virtual environment (if not already active):
On Windows:
'''bash
  venv\Scripts\activate

On macOS/Linux:
'''bash
source venv/bin/activate

2. Run the application:
'''bash
 python main.py

3. Use the GUI to:
- Add or update student records.
- Manage library books and borrowing.
- Scan QR codes for attendance or resource tracking.
- Generate reports or view data.
- Refer to help.txt for detailed instructions, shortcuts, or troubleshooting tips.
